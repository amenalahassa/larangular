### Welcome on Larangular.

A project that combine Laravel and angular together.

I built here an invoice app using Laravel and Angular. The idea is to have a sample app where for an order, you add a list of the articles, and you generate an invoice. You can also export the invoice as a PDF. The backend is built using Laravel and all of them is under this repository. Bad practice, I know, but it was a fun project :D

There are a [template](https://github.com/amenalahassa/larangular-source) that you can clone and use for build your own one.

Hope you enjoy !
